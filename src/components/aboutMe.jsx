            My name is Siddesh and I love exploring cool tech, trying to play
            with it and create useful stuff. I started into Programming only
            when I found out it can ease my life. So I used to write scripts to
            literally to every work I would have to do for hours either. And I
            started freelancing Web development and that's when I got introduced
            into Crypto. Since then I got fascinated with the web3 tech so
            started to learn how to take part in the tech.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I have contributed to various web3 projects in terms of
            content creation and also in touch with great people in the web3
            space. I basically write code and also love doing web3 events.
